============

This is a homework repo hold by Minzhi Liao.

## What did I do in this assignment

A package called `raincouver`. Like most people here, I am getting annoyed by this continuously rainy period, so I build this package to make it easier for people like me to play around with the weather data of city vancouver and get disappointed to vancouver's winter.

## Structure of this repo
This repo contains a reference to the package repo on my github.

The package `raincouver` is here: https://github.com/liao02x/raincouver

If you click the link above, you should see the readme file. I'll leave the link here anyway. https://github.com/liao02x/raincouver/blob/master/README.md

<B><I>The package is pretty documented, so for more information please check the documents in the package repo.
